## Abstract

The object of this study is information systems within the Internet of Things.

The task addressed involves devising an innovative method for detecting and correcting multi-bit data transmission errors in the Internet of Things networks based on Golay codes.

As the main result of the research, a method has been devised for detecting and correcting multi-bit data transmission errors based on Golay codes during byte-by-byte transmission of an information block.

The method devised is distinguished by its coding scheme, which involves calculating 11 control bits and one parity bit for twelve bytes of the original information message with subsequent mixing using shift operations before transmission to the communication channel.

Thus, for twelve bytes of input information, an information block of 24 bytes is formed at the output of the encoder, and the bits of the bytes belong to eight different code words of the extended Golay code (24, 12).

When transmitting an information block, one or more bits of the transmitted byte may be distorted. But after performing the shift operations on the receiving side, the reverse of those performed before transmission, it becomes possible to detect and correct transmission errors using Golay code decoding methods. The transmission errors of a single byte that are subject to detection and correction can reach eight. This is possible because all the bits of a byte transmitted over a communication channel belong to different combinations of the Golay code – each separate combination is formed by bits of different bytes that have the same numbers.

Due to the fact that an information message of 24 bytes consists of eight code combinations of the Golay code (24, 12), it is possible to correct up to 24 bit errors in one message of 24 bytes
