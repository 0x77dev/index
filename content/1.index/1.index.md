## About Index

Index is my personal knowledge repository where I document technical findings, research, my work, the work of others, and other useful information.
This project serves two purposes: to organize my own learning and to share practical knowledge with the broader community.

The platform is built with a focus on longevity and accessibility, implementing:

- IPFS/IPLD integration for content addressing and distributed storage
- Advanced search capabilities for efficient information retrieval
- llms.txt compatibility for AI-assisted navigation and content discovery/ingestion
- Simple, responsive interface optimized for both reference and deep reading

## Using Index

Index is continuously updated as I document new findings and refine existing content. 
Browse through the categorized sections or use the search function to find specific information.

Keep in mind Index is a work in progress and will be updated soon with much more content.
