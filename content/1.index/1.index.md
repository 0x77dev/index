## About Index

Index is my personal knowledge repository where I document technical findings, research, my work, the work of others, and other useful information.
This project serves two purposes: to organize my own learning and to share practical knowledge with the broader community.

This resource is built with a focus on longevity, accessibility, exposes practical structured metadata and APIs, implementing:

- IPFS/IPLD integration for content addressing and distributed storage
- `llms.txt` compatibility for AI-assisted navigation and content discovery/ingestion
- [Schema.org](https://schema.org) for proper structured metadata

## Using Index

Index is continuously updated as I document new findings and refine existing content.
Use search function to find specific information.
