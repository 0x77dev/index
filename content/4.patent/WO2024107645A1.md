## Summary

The invention provides systems and methods for data quality and validity improvement in education institutional, degree, and course license management. The systems utilize an accreditation management system (AMS) that validates educational resources through content validation operations.

Key features include:
- Ingesting educational resources from remote learning management systems (LMS)
- Applying cryptographic hash functions to generate content validation hashes
- Generating unique keys for educational resources
- Receiving data streams from student users engaged with the resources
- Validating consumption of educational resources by extracting keys from data streams
- Generating confidence levels by comparing content validation hashes to content consumption hashes

The technology ensures data integrity across all domains of record-keeping, with data logged in real-time. It enables educational providers to create digital versions of their organizations, governance workflows, learning programs, staff, students, and learning activities, while maintaining regulatory compliance.
