## Summary

This patent describes methods and devices for circumventing network censorship through a peer-to-peer architecture. The technology enables users in censored networks to access restricted content by connecting through volunteer peer devices located in uncensored networks.

Key features include:
- Peer-to-peer network architecture for bypassing censorship
- Volunteer peers that act as proxies for users in censored networks
- NAT traversal techniques including STUN and TURN protocols
- IP address translation between local and global addresses
- Port mapping mechanisms for secure communication

The system allows users to maintain access to the open internet despite censorship measures by routing traffic through volunteer peers in unrestricted networks. The technology overcomes common censorship techniques including DNS poisoning, IP blocking, and deep packet inspection.
